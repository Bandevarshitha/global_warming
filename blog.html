   <p>Global warming refers to the long-term increase in Earth's average surface temperature due to human activities, primarily the emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. These gases trap heat in the atmosphere, creating a "greenhouse effect" that leads to higher temperatures. The main contributors to global warming are the burning of fossil fuels for energy, deforestation, and industrial processes. As a result, the planet is experiencing more extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and the melting of polar ice caps. The consequences of global warming threaten ecosystems, biodiversity, and human societies, exacerbating issues like food and water scarcity, displacement, and health problems. To mitigate global warming, urgent action is needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, transition to renewable energy sources, and promote sustainable practices worldwide.</mark></p>

    <h4>1. Definition: :</h4>
    <li>Global warming refers to the long-term rise in Earthâ€™s average surface temperature due to the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
    <h4>2. Main Causes:</h4>
    <li>Burning of Fossil Fuels: Combustion of coal, oil, and natural gas for energy and transportation.</li>
    <li>Deforestation: Trees absorb carbon dioxide, and deforestation reduces the planet's ability to absorb this gas.</li>
</ul>
<ol type="A" start="1">
    <h4>3. Greenhouse Gases:</h4>
    <li>The primary gases responsible for global warming are carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and fluorinated gases.
    </li>
    <li>Rising Temperatures: Global average temperatures have increased, leading to warmer weather patterns. </li>
</ol>

    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Longer Growing Seasons: In some regions, warmer temperatures may lead to longer growing seasons for crops.</td>
        <td>Rising Sea Levels: Melting ice caps and glaciers contribute to rising sea levels, threatening coastal communities.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Warmer Winters: Milder winters in colder regions may reduce heating costs and improve living conditions in some areas.</td>
        <td>Extreme Weather Events: Global warming causes more frequent and intense storms, floods, heatwaves, and droughts, leading to destruction and loss of life.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>New Shipping Routes: Melting Arctic ice may open up new shipping lanes, potentially reducing transportation costs.</td>
        <td>Threat to Biodiversity: Changing climates disrupt ecosystems, endangering species unable to adapt to the new conditions.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Access to Resources: Thawing ice may make previously inaccessible natural resources, like oil and gas, easier to extract.</td>
        <td>Impact on Agriculture: Unpredictable weather patterns, droughts, and heat stress can damage crops, leading to food shortages.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Potential for Increased Agriculture in Some Areas: Warmer temperatures in cooler regions may increase agricultural production.</td>
        <td>Health Risks: Warmer temperatures can lead to the spread of diseases (e.g., malaria, heatstroke) and worsen air pollution-related health issues.</td>
